**Novel Algorithmic Components**:
```python
# Core innovation: Dynamic edge weight learning
def _compute_dynamic_edge_weights(self, node_features, base_adjacency):
    # Research contribution: Adaptive graph structure learning
    edge_weights = self.edge_weight_learner(pairwise_features)
    combined_weights = base_adjacency * edge_weights + (1 - base_adjacency) * edge_weights * 0.1
    return combined_weights
```

### 2. Intersectional Fairness Index (IFI)
