# Security Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the security framework and practices for the Multimodal Counterfactual Lab project.

## Security Scanning

### Current Implementation

- **Bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated security checks on commit
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning

### Configuration

Security scanning is configured in:
- `pyproject.toml` - Bandit configuration
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit security hooks
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependency monitoring

## Vulnerability Management

### Reporting

Security vulnerabilities should be reported according to [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).

### Response Process

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity using CVSS scoring
2. **Triage**: Assign priority and resources
3. **Remediation**: Develop and test fixes
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinate responsible disclosure
5. **Monitoring**: Track resolution and prevent regression

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review

- All code changes require review via pull requests
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security vulnerability scanning for all dependencies
- License compliance checking
- Supply chain security considerations

### Secrets Management

- No secrets in source code
- Environment variables for configuration
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Regular rotation of authentication tokens

## Compliance Frameworks

### Data Protection

- GDPR compliance for European users
- Privacy-by-design principles
- Data minimization practices
- User consent management

### AI Ethics

- Fairness testing and bias detection
- Transparency and explainability
- Responsible AI development practices
- Ethical use guidelines

## Security Monitoring

### Recommended Tools

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing  
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Image vulnerability assessment

### Metrics and KPIs

- Time to patch critical vulnerabilities
- Security test coverage
- False positive rates
- Security training completion

## Incident Response

### Preparation

- Incident response team identification
- Communication channels established
- Response procedures documented
- Recovery plans tested

### Response Phases

1. **Detection**: Identify security incidents
2. **Analysis**: Assess impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Limit damage spread
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve processes

## Security Training

### Developer Training

- Secure coding practices
- OWASP Top 10 awareness
- Tool usage and best practices
- Regular security updates

### Compliance Training

- Regulatory requirements
- Privacy protection
- Data handling procedures
- Incident reporting

## Risk Assessment

### Common Risks

- **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Model Poisoning**: Malicious training data injection
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Input manipulation for model exploitation
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or tools

### Mitigation Strategies

- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular security assessments
- Continuous monitoring
