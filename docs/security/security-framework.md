# Security Framework

## Overview

Comprehensive security measures for AI/ML fairness research and counterfactual generation systems.

## Security Domains

### 1. Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL for vulnerability detection
- **Dependency Management**: Automated scanning with Safety and pip-audit  
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog for credential exposure prevention
- **Code Quality**: Bandit security linting integration

### 2. Model Security
- **Model Validation**: Safe loading and verification of ML models
- **Input Sanitization**: Robust validation for image and text inputs
- **Output Filtering**: Prevention of sensitive information leakage
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Protection against adversarial attacks

### 3. Data Security
- **Data Anonymization**: Automatic removal of personal identifiers
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage for sensitive datasets
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to model artifacts
- **Data Lineage**: Tracking of data provenance and transformations

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- **Container Hardening**: Trivy scanning and minimal base images
- **Network Security**: Secure communication protocols
- **Secrets Management**: External secret store integration
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and alerting

## Security Scanning

### Enhanced Implementation

- **CodeQL**: Advanced static application security testing
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Safety**: Python dependency security analysis
- **pip-audit**: Comprehensive dependency auditing
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection in code and commits
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated security checks on commit

### Configuration

Security scanning is configured in:
- `pyproject.toml` - Bandit configuration
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit security hooks
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Automated security scanning
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependency monitoring

## Vulnerability Management

### Reporting

Security vulnerabilities should be reported according to [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).

### Response Process

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity using CVSS scoring
2. **Triage**: Assign priority and resources
3. **Remediation**: Develop and test fixes
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinate responsible disclosure
5. **Monitoring**: Track resolution and prevent regression

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review

- All code changes require review via pull requests
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security vulnerability scanning for all dependencies
- License compliance checking
- Supply chain security considerations

### Secrets Management

- No secrets in source code
- Environment variables for configuration
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Regular rotation of authentication tokens

## Compliance Frameworks

### Data Protection

- GDPR compliance for European users
- Privacy-by-design principles
- Data minimization practices
- User consent management

### AI Ethics

- Fairness testing and bias detection
- Transparency and explainability
- Responsible AI development practices
- Ethical use guidelines

## Security Monitoring

### Recommended Tools

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing  
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Image vulnerability assessment

### Metrics and KPIs

- Time to patch critical vulnerabilities
- Security test coverage
- False positive rates
- Security training completion

## Incident Response

### Preparation

- Incident response team identification
- Communication channels established
- Response procedures documented
- Recovery plans tested

### Response Phases

1. **Detection**: Identify security incidents
2. **Analysis**: Assess impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Limit damage spread
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve processes

## Security Training

### Developer Training

- Secure coding practices
- OWASP Top 10 awareness
- Tool usage and best practices
- Regular security updates

### Compliance Training

- Regulatory requirements
- Privacy protection
- Data handling procedures
- Incident reporting

## Risk Assessment

### Common Risks

- **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Model Poisoning**: Malicious training data injection
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Input manipulation for model exploitation
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or tools

### Mitigation Strategies

- Defense in depth
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular security assessments
- Continuous monitoring
