# ADR-002: Evaluation Framework Design

Date: 2025-01-02
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Core Development Team, Fairness Research Team

## Context

The system needs a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess both counterfactual quality and bias detection capabilities. This framework must support regulatory compliance requirements and provide standardized metrics for research reproducibility.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered evaluation framework with standardized fairness metrics, custom quality measures, and regulatory compliance reporting.

### Core Components

1. **Fairness Metrics Layer**
   - Integration with Fairlearn and AIF360
   - Standard metrics: Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Disparate Impact
   - Custom metrics: Statistical Parity Distance, Average Odds Difference

2. **Quality Assessment Layer**
   - CITS (Counterfactual Image-Text Score) implementation
   - Realism assessment using perceptual metrics
   - Attribute fidelity validation
   - Diversity measurements

3. **Compliance Reporting Layer**
   - EU AI Act compliance templates
   - GDPR compliance checks
   - IEEE bias standards validation
   - Audit trail generation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Standardized evaluation across all generation methods
- Regulatory compliance built-in
- Research reproducibility through consistent metrics
- Extensible framework for new metrics
- Automated report generation

### Negative
- Increased computational overhead for evaluation
- Complex configuration for different compliance standards
- Need to maintain multiple metric implementations
- Potential metric conflicts or inconsistencies

### Risks
- Evaluation bottlenecks in high-throughput scenarios
- Compliance standard changes requiring framework updates
- Metric calculation errors affecting research validity

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Minimal Evaluation (Basic metrics only)
- Pros: Fast evaluation, simple implementation, low overhead
- Cons: No compliance support, limited research value, not extensible

### Option 2: External Tools Integration
- Pros: Leverage existing tools, reduce development effort
- Cons: Tool dependency, inconsistent interfaces, limited customization

### Option 3: Comprehensive Framework (Selected)
- Pros: Full control, regulatory compliance, extensibility, research value
- Cons: Development complexity, maintenance overhead

## Implementation Notes

- Evaluation pipeline runs asynchronously to avoid blocking generation
- Metrics are computed in parallel where possible
- Results are cached to avoid recomputation
- Framework supports both batch and real-time evaluation
- Configuration allows selective metric computation

### Metric Prioritization

1. **Critical**: Demographic Parity, CITS Score, Attribute Fidelity
2. **Important**: Equal Opportunity, Realism, Diversity
3. **Optional**: Advanced statistical measures, custom metrics
