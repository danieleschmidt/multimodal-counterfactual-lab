# ADR-003: Model Integration Approach

Date: 2025-01-02
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Core Development Team, ML Engineering Team

## Context

The system needs to integrate with multiple types of models: diffusion models for generation, vision-language models for evaluation, and language models for interpretation. Each model type has different loading patterns, memory requirements, and inference characteristics.

## Decision

We will implement a unified model management system with lazy loading, resource pooling, and standardized interfaces across all model types.

### Core Architecture

1. **Model Registry**
   - Centralized catalog of supported models
   - Version management and compatibility checking
   - Model metadata including resource requirements

2. **Resource Manager**
   - GPU memory allocation and sharing
   - Model instance pooling
   - Dynamic loading/unloading based on usage

3. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Standardized interfaces for each model type
   - Framework-agnostic wrappers (HuggingFace, OpenAI, custom)
   - Consistent error handling and logging

### Supported Model Categories

1. **Diffusion Models**: Stable Diffusion variants, DALL-E
2. **Vision-Language Models**: CLIP, ALIGN, FLAVA, BLIP
3. **Language Models**: BERT, GPT variants, T5
4. **Specialized Models**: Attribute classifiers, quality assessors

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent interface across all model types
- Efficient resource utilization through pooling
- Easy integration of new models
- Automatic compatibility checking
- Centralized model management

### Negative
- Increased abstraction complexity
- Memory overhead from pooling infrastructure
- Potential performance overhead from adapter layer
- Complex dependency management

### Risks
- Resource contention between concurrent model usage
- Model compatibility issues with different frameworks
- Memory leaks in long-running processes

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Direct Model Integration
- Pros: Simple implementation, maximum performance, no abstraction overhead
- Cons: Tight coupling, difficult maintenance, no resource management

### Option 2: Framework-Specific Managers
- Pros: Optimized for each framework, easier debugging
- Cons: Code duplication, inconsistent interfaces, complex integration

### Option 3: Unified Management System (Selected)
- Pros: Consistent interfaces, resource efficiency, easy extensibility
- Cons: Abstraction complexity, development overhead

## Implementation Notes

### Model Loading Strategy
```python
class ModelManager:
    def load_model(self, model_id: str, device: str = "auto"):
        # Check cache first
        # Allocate resources
        # Load with appropriate adapter
        # Register in pool
    
    def get_model(self, model_id: str):
        # Return from pool or load if needed
    
    def release_model(self, model_id: str):
        # Reference counting and cleanup
```

### Resource Allocation
- Priority-based GPU allocation
- Memory threshold monitoring
- Automatic model swapping for optimal resource usage
- Batch inference optimization

### Configuration
```yaml
models:
  diffusion:
    stable_diffusion_v2:
      path: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2"
      memory_requirement: 8GB
      cache_policy: "keep_warm"
  
  vlm:
    clip_vit_base:
      path: "openai/clip-vit-base-patch32"
      memory_requirement: 2GB
      cache_policy: "on_demand"
```
