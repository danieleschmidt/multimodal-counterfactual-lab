# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery (DR) procedures for the Multimodal Counterfactual Lab to ensure business continuity in the event of system failures, data loss, or other catastrophic events.

## Recovery Time and Point Objectives

### Recovery Metrics
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours maximum downtime
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)**: 2 hours average
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime/year)

### Service Tier Classification
- **Tier 1 - Critical**: Core API, model inference (RTO: 1 hour, RPO: 15 minutes)
- **Tier 2 - Important**: Web interface, monitoring (RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour)  
- **Tier 3 - Standard**: Documentation, analytics (RTO: 24 hours, RPO: 4 hours)

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Data Center Outage
**Impact**: Complete service unavailability
**Probability**: Low (< 1% annually)
**Recovery Strategy**: Failover to secondary region

**Immediate Actions** (0-30 minutes):
1. Detect outage via monitoring alerts
2. Verify scope of outage with cloud provider
3. Activate incident response team
4. Initiate DNS failover to secondary region

**Short-term Actions** (30 minutes - 4 hours):
1. Restore services in secondary region
2. Validate data consistency
3. Update external integrations
4. Communicate status to stakeholders

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption/Loss
**Impact**: Data integrity issues, service degradation
**Probability**: Medium (2-3% annually)
**Recovery Strategy**: Point-in-time recovery from backups

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Stop write operations to prevent further corruption
2. Isolate affected database instances
3. Assess extent of data corruption
4. Initiate backup restoration process

**Recovery Steps**:
```bash
# Stop application to prevent writes
kubectl scale deployment counterfactual-lab --replicas=0

# Restore from latest backup
pg_restore -h postgres-primary -U postgres -d counterfactual_lab /backups/latest.sql

# Validate data integrity
python scripts/validate_data_integrity.py

# Resume operations
kubectl scale deployment counterfactual-lab --replicas=3
```

### Scenario 3: Model/Code Corruption
**Impact**: Inference failures, incorrect results
**Probability**: Medium (5% annually)
**Recovery Strategy**: Rollback to last known good version

**Recovery Process**:
1. Identify corrupted components
2. Rollback to previous container image
3. Restore model files from backup
4. Validate model performance
5. Gradually restore traffic

### Scenario 4: Security Breach
**Impact**: Data compromise, service unavailability
**Probability**: Medium (3-5% annually)
**Recovery Strategy**: Isolate, investigate, rebuild

**Immediate Response**:
1. Isolate compromised systems
2. Preserve evidence for investigation
3. Notify security team and authorities
4. Implement enhanced monitoring

## Backup Strategy

### Data Backup Schedule
```yaml
Tier 1 (Critical Data):
  - Frequency: Every 15 minutes
  - Retention: 30 days
  - Storage: Multi-region replication
  - Validation: Daily integrity checks

Tier 2 (Important Data):
  - Frequency: Hourly
  - Retention: 7 days
  - Storage: Cross-region backup
  - Validation: Weekly integrity checks

Tier 3 (Standard Data):
  - Frequency: Daily
  - Retention: 30 days
  - Storage: Single region backup
  - Validation: Monthly integrity checks
```

### Backup Components

#### Application Data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL WAL-E continuous archiving
- **Model Files**: S3 versioning with cross-region replication
- **Configuration**: Git repository with automated backup
- **Logs**: Centralized logging with 30-day retention

#### Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Version controlled and backed up
- **Secrets**: Encrypted backup in secure storage
- **Monitoring Config**: Automated backup to secondary region
- **SSL Certificates**: Secure backup with auto-renewal

### Backup Validation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily backup validation script

# Test database backup
pg_dump -h backup-server -U postgres counterfactual_lab | head -100

# Verify model file integrity
md5sum /backups/models/* > /tmp/backup_checksums.md5
diff /tmp/backup_checksums.md5 /backups/checksums.md5

# Test configuration restore
kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f /backups/k8s-configs/

echo "Backup validation completed: $(date)"
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Automated Recovery

#### Health Check Automation
```yaml
# Health check configuration
health_checks:
  - name: api_health
    endpoint: /health
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 3
    
  - name: model_health
    endpoint: /model/health
    interval: 60s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 2
    
  - name: database_health
    command: "pg_isready -h postgres"
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 3s
    retries: 3
```

#### Auto-failover Configuration
```bash
# Kubernetes deployment with auto-restart
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Always
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /health
          port: 8000
        initialDelaySeconds: 30
        periodSeconds: 10
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /ready
          port: 8000
        initialDelaySeconds: 10
        periodSeconds: 5
```

### Manual Recovery Procedures

#### Step-by-Step Recovery Guide

**Phase 1: Assessment** (0-15 minutes)
1. Identify affected systems and scope of impact
2. Determine appropriate recovery strategy
3. Assemble incident response team
4. Establish communication channels

**Phase 2: Isolation** (15-30 minutes)
1. Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
2. Preserve logs and system state for analysis
3. Stop non-essential services to conserve resources
4. Implement temporary workarounds if possible

**Phase 3: Recovery** (30 minutes - 4 hours)
1. Execute appropriate recovery procedure
2. Restore data from backups if necessary
3. Validate system integrity and functionality
4. Gradually restore traffic and monitor closely

**Phase 4: Validation** (Ongoing)
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Monitor key metrics and error rates
3. Verify data consistency and completeness
4. Confirm all integrations are working

### Region Failover Procedure

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Region failover script

echo "Initiating failover to secondary region..."

# Update DNS to point to secondary region
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z123456789 \
  --change-batch file://dns-failover.json

# Scale up services in secondary region  
kubectl --context=secondary-region scale deployment counterfactual-lab --replicas=5

# Verify services are healthy
kubectl --context=secondary-region get pods -l app=counterfactual-lab

# Run health checks
curl -f https://api-secondary.counterfactual-lab.com/health

echo "Failover complete. Monitoring secondary region..."
```

## Testing and Validation

### Disaster Recovery Testing Schedule

**Monthly Tests**:
- Backup restoration (non-production)
- Database failover simulation
- Application recovery validation

**Quarterly Tests**:
- Full region failover

### Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Database Failover
```bash
# Simulate database failure
kubectl delete pod postgres-primary

# Verify automatic failover
kubectl get pods -l app=postgres

# Validate application connectivity
curl -f https://api.counterfactual-lab.com/health
```

#### Test 2: Application Recovery
```bash
# Delete application pods
kubectl delete deployment counterfactual-lab
