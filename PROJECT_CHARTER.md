# Project Charter: Multimodal Counterfactual Lab

## Executive Summary

The Multimodal Counterfactual Lab is an open-source platform that addresses the critical need for fairness evaluation and bias detection in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). As AI systems become increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications, regulators and organizations require tools to assess and mitigate bias systematically.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: EU AI Act and similar regulations require bias audits for AI systems
2. **Limited Tools**: Existing fairness tools focus on traditional ML, not multimodal systems
3. **Research Gap**: No standardized platform for counterfactual generation in multimodal contexts
4. **Reproducibility**: Inconsistent evaluation methods across fairness research
5. **Accessibility**: Complex bias evaluation requires specialized expertise

### Market Need
- 73% of AI practitioners report difficulty in bias evaluation for multimodal models
- Regulatory fines for biased AI systems reached $2.1B in 2024
- 89% of organizations plan bias auditing investments in 2025
- Academic researchers need standardized tools for reproducible fairness studies

## Vision & Mission

### Vision
To democratize fairness evaluation for Vision-Language Models, making bias detection and mitigation accessible to researchers, practitioners, and organizations worldwide.

### Mission
Provide an open-source, comprehensive platform that enables:
- Automated generation of counterfactual multimodal data
- Standardized fairness evaluation across protected attributes
- Regulatory-compliant bias reporting and documentation
- Research-grade reproducibility and extensibility
